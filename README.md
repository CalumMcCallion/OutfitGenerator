Randomly Generates Outfit From Your Own Clothes

This program was a personal project of mine to further extend my knowledge of SFML. The reason for parts being named SFML_Plot_Points is because I used the file which I had submitted for my coursework and edited it as it had all the SFML file locations set up already, so it was simply to save time.

My future plan is to make this into a mobile app that is universal. As of now, unless you download the repository and put your own pictures into the files and change the locations within the code, then it is only usable for me. I also want to include code that ensures certain colors will not appear at the same time, as most people won't match navy with black, etc.

Now that I don't have to waste time choosing an outfit, I can use that extra time coding!
