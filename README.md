Randomly Generates Outfit From Your Own Clothes

This program was a personal project of mines to further extend my knowledge of SMFL
The reason for parts being named SFML_Plot_Points is because I used the file which I had submitted for my coursework...
and edited it as it had all the SFML file locations set up already so it was simply to save time

My future plans is to make this into an mobile app that is universal.
As of now, unless you download the repository and put your own pictures into the files and change the locations within the...
code then it is only useable for me.
I also want to include code that ensures certain colours will not appear at the same time as most people wont match navy with black etc.

Now that I don't have to waste time choosing an outfit, I can use that extra time coding!
